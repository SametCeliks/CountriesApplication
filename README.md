Developed by Kotlin

  An application that contains the flags and information of many different countries. 
  It retrieves the countries' information from API with Retrofit. The data created with Room is saved to the local database. When the application is refreshed with a swipe, it receives the data from the API to be up to date again. 
  The application used for less than a certain period of time pulls data from SQLite to make it faster.
  Organized the application neatly using MVVM.
